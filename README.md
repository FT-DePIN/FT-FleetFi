# ⚡ Freenergy Tech – FleetFi

### Tokenized EV Fleet Management & Biogas-Powered Swap Infrastructure

Freenergy Tech (FT) is redefining how Africa powers and owns clean mobility.  
We make **electric vehicles affordable for everyone** — by enabling **fractional ownership**, efficient **fleet management**, and **biogas-powered battery swap infrastructure**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

FleetFi is FT’s pilot application built for the **Ilorin Innovation Hackathon 2025**, designed to demonstrate how electric tricycles (E-Keke) can be co-owned, operated, and monetized through tokenized fleet management.

Through FleetFi:
- **Investors** co-own electric vehicles and earn ROI from daily operations.
- **Riders** earn income without owning a vehicle.
- **FT** manages fleet logistics and swap operations, taking a share of swap revenues.

This creates a **sustainable circular ecosystem** — where energy, transport, and capital flow together.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Fractional EV Ownership:**  
   Investors buy tokens representing shares in specific EVs.

2. **Fleet Operations:**  
   FT deploys EVs to verified riders and manages performance data through IoT telemetry.

3. **Battery Swaps:**  
   Riders use FT’s biogas-powered swap stations instead of fuel stations — clean, fast, affordable.

4. **Revenue Sharing:**  
   Daily earnings are split between investors, riders, and FT via transparent smart contracts.

## 💡 Hackathon MVP Scope

The MVP simulates the core workflows of FleetFi:

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| Investor Dashboard | Shows tokenized EVs, expected ROI, and active investment rounds. |
| Operator Dashboard | Manages vehicles, riders, and swap performance metrics. |
| SLX Marketplace | Mock secondary market for investors to buy/sell EV ownership tokens. |
| ESG Tracker | Displays carbon reduction and impact metrics. |

## ⚙️ Architecture

FleetFi’s design integrates a mock simulation of blockchain tokenization, with a clear path to full deployment.

**Architecture Layers:**
- **Frontend:** Google AI Studio (No-code prototype, integrated with mock data)
- **Backend:** Mock database simulating token registry & telemetry logs
- **Telemetry:** Placeholder data modeled from Qoray API schema
- **Blockchain (Future):** Trovotech × Bantu Network integration (SEC sandbox-ready)

## 🔗 Integration with Trovotech

Freenergy Tech’s tokenization framework will connect to **Trovotech’s SEC-ARIP-licensed VASP infrastructure** to ensure all EV and swap-station assets are legally compliant for fractional ownership and investor payouts.

## 🌍 Market Opportunity

Nigeria’s 3M+ commercial tricycles spend **₦5 trillion yearly on petrol** — FleetFi replaces that with **renewable battery swapping**.  
Ilorin (pilot city) provides the testbed for a **biogas-powered EV swap network** before scaling nationally.

---

## 🧠 Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Key Milestones |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Pilot** | Q1 2025 | Launch 3 E-Kekes + 1 biogas swap station |
| **Scale-Up** | Q2–Q3 2026 | Expand to 6 EVs + 3 swap hubs; onboard 50+ investors |
| **Commercial Rollout** | 2027 | Integrate with Trovotech sandbox, onboard 200+ token holders |
| **Regional Expansion** | 2028 | Enter Ghana, Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire; MRV carbon certification |
